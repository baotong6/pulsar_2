"""
(1) Conditions on the frequencies...

Drop the zero frequency and the nyquist frequency since these do
not have the exponential distribution.

(2) Conditions on the observed powers

Need to drop the observed power at the zero and nyquist frequencies, since
those frequencies have been dropped.

Would also be good to normalize the power spectrum in some way so that priors
can be more independent of the data.  Note that this can also be handled by
adjusting the prior, rather than normalizing the data.
